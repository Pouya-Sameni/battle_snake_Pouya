## immediate
- The eat_map isn't actually used yet; snake just avoids certain death
- refactor food searchingâ€“ currently eats quite a lot
- there are still some bugs + dumb deaths
- pathfinding to avoid getting trapped; find larger map section to enter

## more ambitious
- trap other snakes
- use health information of other snakes
- less greedy/nearsighted. Look beyond 1 square LOL
